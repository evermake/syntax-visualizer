## Motivation

> There are many programmers who want to understand the concept of an
> Abstract Syntax Tree, and, more importantly, there also people who study
> compilers and researchers who are interested in the Node Coordinates Matrix
> representation of the AST. The goal of this project is to create an online
> tool for generating AST and NCM from code in real time to make the process
> of exploring these concepts more convenient.

## Features

- [Node Coordinates Matrix](#nodes-coordinates-matrix)
- Sharing snippets
- Nodes highlighting
- Restoring written code on page reopen
- JavaScript language support

## Usage

Open [Syntax Visualizer](https://evermake.github.io/syntax-visualizer/) in the browser and just type the code into the editor and see the result!
Pretty straightforward, right?

## Demo

## Run locally

You can clone and run project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/evermake/syntax-visualizer.git
cd syntax-visualizer
npm install
npm run dev
```

git, nodejs (tested on version 16) and npm are required.

## Nodes Coordinates Matrix

Node Coordinates Matrix is a representation of "an encoding of the inter-node relationships between nodes in an AST" [[1]](#references).
In conjunction with the Key operator this concept is necessary for performing parallel computations over an AST: "...permits arbitrary computation over sub-trees of an AST using purely data-parallel array programming techniques" [[1]](#references).

Please, read [this article](#references) for more information.
